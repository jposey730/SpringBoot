This is a very basic REST api that I created using Spring Boot.  I am currently extending it so the data is not hard coded but 
fetched from a DB. If you want to do a simple GET method just run it and access localhost:8080/teams.  For the other methods (POST, PUT and DELETE) you can use postman (addon for chrome).
